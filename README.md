# odin-linked-lists-project
This is the linked lists project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about practicing the linked list data structure using JavaScript.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in linked list thinking using my knowledge around computer science.

Self-reflection and conclusion:
this was an opportunity to practice linked list theory.
